# MNIST_ADV_TARG_ATT
Confusion and entropy matrices for targetted attacks.
Filename explanation:
X_TFGSM_Y_Z_T.pdf
X: Loss function;
Y: epsilon stepsize;
Z: confusion or entropy;
T: targetted digit;
So, CE_TFGSM_256_conf_7.pdf will show the confusion matrix of a cross-entropy-based attack, that targets the digit 7 with stepsize 0.256.
